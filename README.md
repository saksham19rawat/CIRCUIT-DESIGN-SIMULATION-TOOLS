# CMOS_INVERTER

## INTRODUCTION
This project focuses on the design and simulation of a CMOS Inverter, a fundamental building block in digital electronics. The aim was to understand its working principles and go through the complete VLSI design flow, starting from schematic to layout and verification.

To achieve this, I used Xschem for schematic design and symbol generation, followed by **NGSPICE** for circuit simulation and waveform analysis. The layout was implemented using **MAGIC VLSI**,**NETGEN** also integrated open-source **PDKs-SKY130**.

This is my first-ever project and also my first GitHub repository, so I’ll try to keep things as **simple and transparent** as possible—so both the person writing this (me) and the one reading it know exactly where we’re headed.

### BEGINNING 
Alright
